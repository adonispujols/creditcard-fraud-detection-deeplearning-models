With increased digital financial transactions, credit fraud has surged, causing significant monetary losses. Our aim for this project is to tackle this issue by developing a machine learning-based solution that can properly handle the accurate detection of fraudulent credit card activities. Utilizing a large dataset from Kaggle, we explored various models including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and an ensemble approach combining Bagging with XGBoost. This project underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing the security of financial transactions, offering promising ways to mitigate the impact of credit card fraud. We used Python with Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas libraries.
